</h1>
            <p class="mbr-text py-3 mbr-fonts-style display-7">A blog is a great place to share ideas, thoughts, and whatever else you think you have people might like to hear from you. Its a great place for people to know about what others think about a certain topic/idea/problem and how certain people respond to it. This might help you looking the life in a completely different way, and may give you the answers you seek for! Once you start sharing your ideas and start asking your doubts, you will become a part of the big community called 'World' where everyone is asking and giving opinions.
<br><br>The idea to make a blog of this kind grew up in my mind when I was in my last semester of the University. I was sitting alone that day, and thinking what to do... then I asked myself what people do when they have their free time! I started finding clues, from wandering around to googling, when I came to know that people have different things to do. Things grow up the ideas that we have and these ideas have no limits! They can grow from a 'tadpole' size to the size of the universe, yet thoughts come and ideas grow more and more.
<br>
<br>Even as a young child, I would conjure up stories with my imagination, sharing them with anyone who was around to listen. I’ve developed my storytelling and written quite a bit since then, but the essence of creativity I began with as a kid has remained a major influence on my work.
<br><br>Ideas are always great, as they may provide you some brilliant brains and may cherish you with new and important inventions (for instance: google), but these ideas also include 'perceptions' (ways of thinking about a certain topic), and as people say 'perception varies from person to person'. Therefore, where there are ideas, there are contradictions! By discussing the ideas with people, and discussing problems with others, you may find a different way to look at your ideas/problems.
<br><br>This community is intended for the people who want to join the vast community of people who want to explore the problems of the world. People who join the community can ask whatever they have in their mind, and there will be people to answer their questions as well! This blog will be a problem-solving for the kinds of problems that can not be asked anywhere/do not want to ask somewhere due to any reasons you may have.
<br><br>​I have no intention of slowing down anytime soon. Get in touch with me if you’ve got any comments, questions, suggestions, or just want to say hello. I’d be more than happy to hear from you.
